# HTML Sync

**A WordPress plugin that loads post content from static HTML files.**

Specify a folder on your server and link HTML files contained in that folder to WordPress pages. The content of the page will be replaced with the content of the respective HTML file.

The content will be synced every hour, so if you make changes to the HTML file, the page will be updated automatically. 

HTML Sync is limited to the page post type right now, but could easily be extended to support other post types as well.
